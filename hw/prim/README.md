# Prim Wrappers

These prim wrappers were autogenerated by running the fusesoc "setup" step in
the OpenTitan top-level directory (any random target works, but I used lint):

`fusesoc --cores-root . run --setup --target lint lowrisc:systems:top_earlgrey`

I then copied the generated wrappers into this directory using (starting from
`hw/`):

`mv opentitan/build/lowrisc_systems_top_earlgrey_0.1/src/lowrisc_prim_abstract*/* prim/`

Note: OpenTitan primgen requires using a custom version of FuseSoC, which will
be installed automatically if you set up a virtualenv from
`opentitan/python-requirements.txt`.
